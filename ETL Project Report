ETL PROJECT REPORT 3.10.20
------------------------------------------------------------

EXTRACT:
Data for our ETL project came from the following sources:
•	Data from Trumptwitterarchive.com extracted as a JSON file
•	Stock data from Yahoofinace.com extracted with "yahoo_fin.stock_info import get_data".

------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSFORM:
Before joining the two datasets:
•	Trumptwitterarchive Data:
o	Export the data as a JSON file
o	Removed unnecessary columns
o	Created data frame using Pandas.
o	Removed the time stamp from the date by creating a new column to reflect date only
o	Removed the column with date & time stamp.
o	Reordered columns to match the stock data.

•	Yahoo Stock Data:
o	Stock data was read into Jupyter notebook.
o	Reset index which was reflected as dates.
o	Renamed index “date”
o	Removed the time stamp from the date by creating a new column to reflect date only
o	Removed the column with date & time stamp.
o	Reordered column to match the stock data.

-------------------------------------------------------------
LOAD:
It was decided the data would be loaded into an SQL database with “date” as Primary Key.
•	Both datasets were loaded into SQL using SQLAlchemy
•	Data tables were created for each of the different types of Stock Data (NASDAQ, Dow Jones, S&P and Russell) and a data table for the Trump Tweets data.
